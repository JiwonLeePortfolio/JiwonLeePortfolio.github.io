          <h3>My services</h3>

          <p1>
            Service 1 (<a class = "linkten" target = "_blank" href = "https://tamuhack.com"  >Hackathon</a>):
            As A&M held its biannual hackathon, I participated in serving food and guiding the contestants in the right direction. Throughout the 48-hour event,
            I took charge of distributing resources, such as food or merchandise, and maintaining order as groups would huddle to a speaker event. It was a very valuable
            experience for me as I was able to talk to the contestants, listen to their ideas, and see their prototypes. This gave me an insight into what goes into 
            organizing and managing a large-scale event.
            <br><br>
            Service 2 (<a class = "linkten" target = "_blank" href = "https://www.circleofriends.org"  >Circle Of Friends</a>):
            As a member of Circle of Friends, an organization that spreads awareness of special needs and allows students to get to know the 
            special needs students at their high school, I participated in many fundraising events sponsored by Circle of Friends. One year, Circle of Friends
            had held a golf tournament in which families and friends could gather around and socialize or participate in the competition.  I had a lot of fun managing
            the booths and handing out refreshments to participants. The experience allowed me to gain experience in taking responsibility for the overall operation.
