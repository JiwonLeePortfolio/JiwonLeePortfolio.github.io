            <h3> Most Recent Project</h3>
            <p1>
              &nbsp &nbsp The most recent project I have been working on is this website. While making this website, I had a
              lot of fun but also gained valuable experience. Never having experience with Javascript and CSS, 
              I first had to learn what effect these had specifically on websites. As I had first learned C++ through a simple program 
              that printed "Hello World," I went about learning Javascript and CSS in the same fashion. After making the skeleton with HTML, 
              I made a CSS file that changed the background color and a Javascript file that displayed a prompt box for the website user. <br>
              &nbsp &nbsp Through this, I grasped the concept of languages and their importance. CSS allows us to color and decorate the 
              website however we would like. Then Javascript is added to provide responsive features that interact with the actions of the user. 
              Both files help the user have a more exciting and visually appealing experience while using the website. <br>
              &nbsp &nbsp The biggest challenge I faced while making this website was aligning and centering all the lists. The internet did not 
              have the information I needed to fix the problem. I overcame the problem by referring to my friends who were able to 
              perfectly align their links. Gaining design ideas was also a challenge to devise. Going to professional marketing websites and 
              inspecting their element helped me see how I could go about applying the same techniques to my website. <br>
              &nbsp &nbsp Overall, there were lots of resources available to solve any problems with the website. This project was very fun to 
              work with because I was able to directly see the creation. The programs I have previously created mainly showed its output to the 
              terminal in black and white. This program showed me a different aspect of programming that involved less algorithmic thinking and more 
              calling and assigning premade attributes.  
            </p1>

            <h3> Most Favorite Project</h3>
            <p1>
              &nbsp &nbsp My favorite project I have worked on was a program that edited photos. This is one of the first projects I have worked on to learn
              about coding so it was very fascinating to me. The purpose of the program was to edit based on the input of choice. Changing the photo with different filters,
              flipping the image, and seam carving outlines was a great intro to coding and algorithms. After creating the program on my own, I searched online and asked
              my friends how they went about solving the problem, then implemented any novel ideas that improved the efficiency and organization of the code. This project
              was a great project to get started in coding as it helped me grasp the fundamentals needed for coding. 
            </p1>

            <h3> Future Projects</h3>
            <p1>
              &nbsp &nbsp We have access to an infinite database of projects created by a diverse range of people. When scrolling through what other people have created, 
              I get the motivation to create something that is unique to me. One project I have been intrigued to work on is a Raspberry Pi project. Although there is not much
              computing power, it is nonetheless a computer. The limitations seek to challenge and expand one's creativity. I would like to get a Raspberry Pi and 
              create a motion sensor so I can also learn about machine learning using the OpenCV library. I would like to work on this project and further expand my 
              knowledge in computer science.
