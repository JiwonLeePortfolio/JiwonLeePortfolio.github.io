# CSCE_315_Lab

#This is Jiwon Lee's website. 

I added a toggle feature to swtich between 2 different .css files. The website remains the same theme after refreshing.  

On one of the .css files, I made a split screen and hid the scroll bar. 

I added .hover attributes so links would change color when you hover over them. 

I added a button to show and hide the resume.

I made external links open a new tab and internal links stay on the same tab.
