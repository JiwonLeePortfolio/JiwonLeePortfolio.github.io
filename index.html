          <h3>About Me</h3> <!-- This is a comment! -->
            <p1>
            
              I am currently a junior majoring in Computer Science B.S. at <a class = "linkten" target = "_blank" href = "https://www.tamu.edu"  > Texas A&M University.</a> 

              I started my computer science journey during high school after taking an intro to computer science class. Signing up for the class,
              I didn't fully understand what Computer Science was exactly and how pivotal it was to our history. After writing my first program, I 
              thought programming was just learning a new language in which you can speak to computers. However, I now know that being able to speak to 
              computers is a very valuable skill that can do much to exponentiate your efficiency and creativity. Looking back, I am glad to be studying in 
              a field that offers diversity in what you can work with. 

              <br><br>
              In a working environment, I enjoy collaborating with others and listening to their point of view because it always allows the group to observe 
              the problem in a different way.
